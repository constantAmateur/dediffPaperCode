These scripts contain the code necessary to:

1. importing exposures and merging data together to produce mean& sd used for figure 1 plotting

2. A simple example script showing how we run the cellSignalAnalysis tool in the HPC ebi cluster.

3. Scripts with pre-processing of tabula sapiens and the fetal reference Han et.al.

The construction of the gastrulation and early embryo references are described in the liverAndGutAnalysis folder.
